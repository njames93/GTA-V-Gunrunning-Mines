# GTA-V-Gunrunning-Mines
Enables the mines from Gunrunning DLC in single player mode for Grand Theft Auto:V

# Build
To build this you will need a copy of the ScriptHookV SDK which can be attained from [here](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/).
Place the extracted SDK contents into the empty SDK folder.

You will need to use Visual Studio 2017(15.3) or later in order to bulid this.

# Installation
After building, copy the asi file from the build directory into your Grand Theft Auto V directory and make sure you have the latest version of [ScriptHookV](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/) and an asi loader(SHV comes with one).

This mod only enables the mines, in order to actually spawn the cars you will need a trainer which is up to date, alternatively you can use this mod [EnableMpCars](https://github.com/zorg93/EnableMpCars-GTAV).

# Usage
When in game get in any of the vehicles:
  * apc
  * dune3
  * halftrack
  * tampa3
  * insurgent3
  * technical3

Then you can press the horn button (Defaults to 'E' on keyboard) and it will drop a proxy mine. 
If you are using a trainer that can edit vehicle mods you can bring up the cheat input text box (default '`' on Keyboard) and type "minemod".
This will only enable the mines on vehicles if you have enabled the Proximity mine vehicle mod on the vehicle in your trainer
